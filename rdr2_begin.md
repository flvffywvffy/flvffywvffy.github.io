# Beginners Guide to Red Dead Redemption 2

- **Don't try to explore the open world of the game right away, because it's not available from the very beginning of the game.** You will unlock its largest part after advancing to chapter 2 of the campaign, but you still won't be able to explore Blackwater and New Austin, where the character would be attacked immediately. You will have access to these locations only towards the end of the game.
- **Save the game manually every-so-often.** This can save you from many potentially troublesome situations, e.g. accidentally triggering a chase from the authorities, losing your horse or selecting the wrong option during important choices.
- **Return to the gang's camp regularly.** It offers many activities, including e.g. interactions with other gang members or new mission opportunities. It's also worth spending your money on expanding the camp to unlock its new upgrades (e.g. the fast travel option).
- **Search the enemies' bodies and all explored locations.** The game offers a lot of valuable loot. Apart from cash and ammo, you can find e.g. consumable items, animal trophies or treasures you can sell.
- **Remember to regularly clean the weapons you use often** - to do so, you need a special oil. This will reduce the risk of the weapon jamming during combat, and allow you to restore its stats to their initial (maximum) value.
- **You don't have to use the same horse throughout the whole game.** RDR2 allows you to buy and tame new mount, which aside from a different coat color may also have different statistics (e.g. increased stamina).
